    Since we're only looking for a pair, the simplest way to implement this to me is to loop through the elements and progressively add them to a set.
 
    For each element, we check if (expected value) - element = (any value in my set)

/**
 
    Now let's say that the requirements change. We want to be able to determine if for a given array of integers, there is any combination of N elements which sum return K
 
    Since we're doing a sum, the order doesn't really matters, so we're going to build all the possible combinations as we're drawing our elements
 
    Imagine that you have the input [0, 1, 2, 3] and you're looking for a combination of 3 elements, the possibilities are:
    - [0, 1, 2]
    - [0, 1, 3]
    - [0, 2, 3]
    - [1, 2, 3]
 
    Another way to visualize it is to imagine trees:
 
    - 0
      | - 1
          | - 2
          | - 3
      | - 2
          | - 3
    - 1
      | - 2
          | - 3
 
    Since the order doesn't matter, we can build the branches of a tree based on the "rest" of the sub-array (the initial array minus all elements before the current node element). We also stop the process when there is n = k-1 elements in the array
 
    Let's build a branch structure that can hold other branches:

        self.value = value
        self.maxLevel = maxLevel
        self.level = level
        self.rest = rest
        self.branches = []
    }

/**
 
    Now we need a function that build children branches. Basically we need to tell a branch:
 
    "grow more branches up to level X"
 
    Let's build a trunk structure that can tell the branches "how far" they can extend
    EDIT: I realized that a trunk is actually just a branch (with the exception that it was holding a "maxValue") so I decided to refactor my code
