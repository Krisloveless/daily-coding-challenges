/**
 
    In this problem, we're trying to find a combination of element of set for which the sum is equal of the sum of the rest.
 
    I don't know how manage multisets in swift (not sure if it exists) so I'll use arrays
 
    It's like picking a random element until we either:
 
    - Reach a value that correspond to the sum of the rest (in which case we return true)
    - Reach a value that is greater than the sum of the rest (in which case we return false)
 
    The order in which we pick the element counts
 
    To build such an algorithm, we can try to use a tree, each node correspond to the new picked element
