    However, I quickly realize that this doesn't work for the example: "([])[]({})"
 
    Well formed isn't defined by symetry.
 
    A simple way to define it is : "Every opening bracket has its closing bracket"

    Let's write a function that does this, it scans the characters, if it's an opening bracket it stores it in an array of opening brackend, if it's a closing one, it checks that it matches the last opening one in the array and continue
