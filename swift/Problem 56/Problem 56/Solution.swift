    I had no idead whatadjacency matrix adjacency matrix meant, so I look it up: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix#Undirected_graphs
 
    The first graph in the abode link shows that the the node 4 has 3 relations (by looking at the column 4 or row 4, the node 6 has 1 relation, etc...
 
    It seems that max(sum(row)) gives us how many unique color (relation) are required minimum for not having adjacent vertexes with the same color
