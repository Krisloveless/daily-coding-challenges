/**
 
 First thought is: it's simple, since I can return any combination, I just have to loop through the array of work and stop every time I catch a word
 
 But this won't work for something like this:
 - Possibilities: ["ab", "a", "b", "bc"]
 - Input: "abc", as the algorithm would find "ab" and then would stuck on the "c" (while ["a", "bc"] is possible)
 
 So then I'm thinking sorting my array of possibilities per length:
 - Possibilities: ["ab", "a", "b", "bc"]
 - Transformed = ["a", "b", "ab", "bc"]
 - Input: "abc"
 But the same problem happens: it would return ["a", "b"] and then get stuck.
 
 So then, I'm thinking brute force:
 I create a recursive function that will progressively build my output and everytime it get stucks, it tries a different path
 But here, I feel like it would be way too agresive: it works fine when I just need to change the path of the last node, but what if all path for the node N aren't working? I should loop back to the previous node and check if there is any alternative and if not I keep looping back
 
 Rather than looping back indefinitively (and keeping track of it to avoid duplicate paths), I should probably try to build all possible paths
 I will basically build a function that takes a string as input and return a list of (a: string, b: string) where a is a possibility pulled and b the "rest" of the input

                result.append((possiblitiy, String(self.suffix(self.count - possiblitiy.count))))
            }
