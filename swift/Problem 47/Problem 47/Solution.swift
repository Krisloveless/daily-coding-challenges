    Ok after testing, I've seen what I forgot to take into consideration:
 
    You need to buy the stock **before** you sell it (even though it was clearly mentioned in the exercise, I assume this was simple and skipped the first minutes analysing...)
 
    How do we fix this?
 
    What if we start from the end of our array, grab the largest value and look at the largest gap we can have with any of value before it?
 
    First we write a function that find the largest gap in a sub array based on the last value (this is basically finding the smallest value in the array)
