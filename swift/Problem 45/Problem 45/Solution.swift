    Ok this might not be the best solution, but that comes immediately into mind after reading the exercise.
 
    If ran5() gives me a random value between 1 & 5 inclusive, then I can run rand5() X times and divide the result by X to produce randX()
 
    1+1+2+2+3+5+5 / 7
 
    The biggest problem with this is that we will most likely get a decimal value.
 
    It can be solve for almost any case if we truncate the value:
 
    - [1-1.99] = 1
    - [2-2.99] = 2
    - ...
    - [6-6.99] = 6
    - [7] = 7
 
    The problem here is that the chances to have a 7 is 100 times (?) smaller than any other values (or at least smaller)
 
    What if I run it X+1 times?
 
    - [1-1.99] = 1
    - ...
    - [7-7.99] = 7
    - 8 = ?
 
    While it's not really efficient, what I would do here is that I would just re-run the function if I get an 8.
 
    Let's write this:
 
 */
struct SigmaChallenge {
    
    static func rand5() -> Int {
        return Int.random(in: 1...5)
    }
    
    static func rand7() -> Int {
        return (rand5() + rand5() + rand5() + rand5() + rand5() + rand5() + rand5()) / 7
    }
}
/**
 
    After testing, I wasn't able to get at least a 4...
 
    I didn't troubleshoot as I also realize that all my thoughts earliers weren't correct:
 
    There is actually more possible combinations to get a 3 that there is to get a 7
 
    The only change to have 7 is to draw 7 times 7, for 3 its any combination that give 7 * 3 = 21
 
    Let's get back to the roots.
 
    - If I draw rand5() twice, I can get any value between 2...10 (9 possibilities)
    - If I draw rand5() 3 times, I can get any value between 3...15 (13 possibilities)
    - If I draw rand5() 4 times, I can get any value between 4...20 (17 possibilities)
    - If I draw rand5() 5 times, I can get any value between 5...25 (21 possibilities)
 
     The problem here is that I get a random value between N...M where N > 1, I want N to be equal to 1, I can substract 4, this would give me a change to have any value between 1 and 21. But then, we're back to the initial problem where the chance to have 1 is smaller than the chances to have 2 (1 has only one possibility, drawing 1 all the time, 2 has multiple possibilities by swapping 2s with 1s and 3s).
 
    If I draw rand5, multiply by 5 and substract 4, I have equal chances to draw 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, but I want equal chances to get any values in between as well, so I can add to this a rand5(), this will give me equal chances to have 1+(1-5), 6+(1-5), 11+(1-5), 16+(1-5), 21+(1-5), or equal chances to have any values between 1 and 26
 
    What we can do is that since 21 is a multiple of 7, we could just ignore values > 21 and re-run the function until we get a value between 1 and 21, this might not be the most efficient method however we will always have equal value to draw anything between 1 and 21 at any iteration.
 
    Finally, we just have to divide the result by 3 and truncate (just like we we doing in the first attempt)

    Now we need to test this, we can simply run it X times and calculate the probability of each (the greater is X and the closer to 1/7 we should get)
 
    After the tests, this doesn't seem correct...
 
    I realized a mistake earlier, I have random values between 2 and 26, not 1 and 26. So instead of subtracting 4, I will substract 5 which will give me a random value between 0 and 25 and I will just have to swap my values (0 means 1, 1 means 2, ..., 20 means 21)
 
    I also found that rand5() wasn't uniform. I updated the function and added a test for it
