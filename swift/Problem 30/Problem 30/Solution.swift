     Let's imagine that we had a really simple "valley" like [4,0,4], then it would be pretty straight forward, it would fill 4 units of water before overflowing on both left and right sides
 
     If one of the boudaries were smaller than the other: [2, 0, 4], then imagine the rain dropping from the highest point and slowing flowing on the other side, it would fill 2 units in the center and then flow out. We can actually apply this logic of dropping from the highest point in the previous example as well
 
     Now if we had something a little more complex like [2, 0, 3, 0, 5], it would still workd as we would start from the last index and it would flow slowly to the left
 
     let's increase the complexity even more with [1, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 2], this time, we find  on of the highest point, the second index for example, we fill to the left which gives 1 unit of water before overflowing, then we apply the same rule to the right side, it fills 5 units of water, 0 units, 2 units and it overflows.
 
     Another way to imagine it is to grab a sub-section of the array, the one with the highest boundaries [5, 0, 5] and fill it (5 units). We then replace the sub-section by a wall of the max height [1, 0, 5, 0, 2]. We apply this logic again until the whole map is filled.
 
    Let's start with the first part detecting the two largest walls and the center of it. It's it's an even number it would start at mid+1, if it's an odd number it would start

    Ok it works, while building it, I realized that I should do two things:
 
    Replace the substracted sub-array from the input with a wall that would correspond to the maximum height of my computed result
 
    Let's start to build a function that fill an array where we know that the boundaries are the higher walls

    Now that we have these two functions, we can start iterating through the initial map.
 
    The logic is that:
 
    - We grab the first sub-array with highest boundaries and fill it
    - We replace the sub-section of the initial array with a wall of the maximum height (returned by the previous function)
    - We start again
    - The end condition should be when the initial map became a single wall
