     I'm not familiar with preorder and inorder of a binary tree, given the example, it seems that
 
     - preorder starts from the root and goes down from the left side of the tree, it has to finish all of a sub-tree before tackling the next branch of the parent tree
     - inorder starts from the last branch and gets back to its parents, it needs to scan all nodes of a subtree before going to the parent of the sub-tree
 
     Given those facts what kind of rules do I know from inorder and preorder arrays?
 
     Preoder trees
     - the first element of a preorder array is the root of my binary tree
     - the last element of a preorder array is a child of the last level of the tree
     - Two neighbours elements are either
     - parent/child
     - siblings (they cannot be grand-parent/grand-child)
 
     Inorder trees
     - the first element of an inorder array is a node of the last level of the tree
 
     Other
     - Looking at the example, it seems that all the elements between preorder[0] and preorder[x] where preorder[x] = inorder[0] are all the nodes from the root to the bottom left of the tree. This seems to be a good intuition and I want to see what else I can see once I remove these elements (based on the example)
 
     the tree is
 
     ```
         a
        / \
       b   c
      / \ / \
     d  e f  g
     ```
 
     * preorder: `[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]`
     * inorder: `[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]`
     * preorder[0] = a, inorder[0] = d = preorder[2] =>
 
     preorder[0] -> preorder[1] -> preorder[2] are the left branches, let's remove them and see we have
 
     * preorder: `[e, c, f, g]`
     * inorder: `[b, e, a, f, c, g]`
 
     my inorder[0] corresponds to b which is one of the element of the previous preorders
 
     I feel like it's going somewhere but it would get really complicated in terms of if/else statements
 
     I can see another pattern where I observe each element and their neighbours from both arrays:
 
     * First I'm looking at a, it has only b as siblings, in the inorder it has e & f, since a is the root (first element of preorder) I'll will ignore its inorder siblings and I will assume that b is its direct left child
     * b has a and d, a being its parent, I know that d is either its sibling or its left child
        * b has d and e in inorders, so d is the direct left child
     * d has b & e, b being its parent, e can be its sibling or its left child
        * d has only b, so e is its sibling
 
     This looks good so far, let's try to build it
 
    First I will build a node class, it has a value, a reference to its parent, its left child and its right child. They can be nil
